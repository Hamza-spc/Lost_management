## How the Email System Works

### Complete Workflow:

1. **Client Login** â†’ Client record created in database
2. **Client Reports Item** â†’ Item linked to client via `clientId`
3. **Staff Updates Status** â†’ Email sent to client's email address
4. **Client Receives Email** â†’ Notification about found item
5. **Client Sees Options** â†’ Pickup or delivery choices

### Email Content:

```
Subject: Your Lost Item Has Been Found!

Hello [Client Name],

Great News! Your [Item Title] was found now!

Please check your app to determine whether you want to pick it up or have it delivered.

Best regards,
